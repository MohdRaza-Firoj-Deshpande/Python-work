'''
Tuples are a form of  list that cannot be changed or are immuttable
 For example, if we have a rectangle that should always be a certain size, we 
can ensure that its size doesnâ€™t change by putting the dimensions into a tuple

'''
tup = (200, 50)
print(type(tup))

dimensions=[10,20,30]
print(type(dimensions))

for types in type:
    print(type)
'''
dimensions = (200, 50)
print("Original dimensions:")
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)
